> disclaimer section. Some of the thoughts and techniques ahead are things that I've found personal success in.
Though much of the content will be sourced with links.
It should be noted that some the things written here are my own opinions on what I've found success with.

## Opening Framing (1/1)

Workshops are meant to engage your audience.

Because we, as instructors, are taking valuable parts of people's schedule, we want to optimize the amount of impact we have in a given amount of time.

How do we do that? Well there are lots of schools of thought surrounding this.

To start us formulating our own opinion let's take a look at some wikipedia points of interest on [`andragogy`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy)

## Andragogy (2/3)

Andragogy is the science of understanding and supporting lifelong education of adults. It became much more popularized by educator Malcolm Knowles where he wanted to promote a larger distinction between pedagogy(child learning) and andragogy(adult learning)

### Andragogy - discussion (5/8)

Read over the following 6 bullet points for the next 2 minutes. Then with your table answer the following:

- Is there anything that we've read that isn't obvious about adults?
- Why might it be important to consider these factors when building out a lesson or workshop?

Knowles' theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:

-  **Need to know**: Adults need to know the reason for learning something.
-  **Foundation**: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
-  **Self-concept**: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
-  **Readiness**: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
-  **Orientation**: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
-  **Motivation**: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.

## Learning objectives - exercise 1 (8/16)
As a group, pick a topic for a workshop or class your group would like to teach.(dont worry, we wont actually teach in this class.. or will we!?) Perhaps it's a class you've been wanting to teach or a fun subject like baking 101. Try to pick something you have a decent domain knowledge on.

Knowing what you know about learning objects... which is whatever you came with before this class started.

As a group, write 3 learning objectives for the topic your group has chosen. As the class continues, you can modify these however your group wishes to modify these. In fact, it's highly encouraged! However, for fun, let's maintain the original learning objective written in this exercise pure for comparison later.

## Checks on learning (4/20)

Now that we have some learning objectives. Workshops need to be able to measure against those learning objectives.
In workshops and one off classes, instructors generally only need [formative learning assessments](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/basics/formative-summative.html).

Formative assessments allow students "to provide ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching and by students to improve their learning." [quoted here](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/basics/formative-summative.html)

The end goal is already there. To teach a specific thing or set of specific things accurately. Formative assessments allow the instructor to guage the feedback and adjust fire should they want to.

Summative assessments through feedback is good to see if time permits. But really only helps the instructor for the next iteration of the class. However, it is extremely effective to get iterative feedback for a specific workshop.

> here's just some formative checks on learning I personally have found effective

> As a side note Checks on learning should be viewed as an educational tool not simply a diagnostic one for the instructor.

### examples
#### Think Pair Share || Think Ink Pair Share
This was actually the first check on learning we did. It allows students to guide discussion.

#### I do you do or vice versa
Instructor does or explains something then allows the student to mirror the activity. The flipped version can be effective as well. Where some initial path can be carved out for the student to attempt and activity. Then the instructor solves by showing methodolgy and approach.

#### Fist to 5
This is a tool where you can guage anecdotal levels of understanding of a subject. Where you let the students know holding a fist up represents a "0" level of knowledge and 5 fingers for "5" representing an expert level of knowledge. You could pivot into a lower barrier to entry if you see more 1's then you should. Or if you see more middle of the road you can give a bit more exposition and detail.

> There's a wide variety of ways for students to interact with an instructor and fellow students. Ultimately that's one of our responsibilities as instructors. Finding the most effective ways for students to consume the information we're presenting. In some cases, we might not want to use a check on learning at all



academic habits, they once possessed are also long forgotten

building community and sense of ownership of learning


 -- pertinent to the learning objectives
## Adult learning theory

- Moves from dependency to increasing selfdirectedness
as he/she matures and can direct
his/her own learning;
- Draws on his/her accumulated reservoir of life
experiences to aid learning;
- Is ready to learn when he/she assumes new social
or life roles;
- Is problem-centered and wants to apply new
learning immediately; and
- Is motivated to learn internally rather than externally

implications for practice:

Set a cooperative climate for learning in the classroom;
• Assess the learner’s specific needs and interests;
• Develop learning objectives based on the learner’s
needs, interests, and skill levels;
• Design sequential activities to achieve the objectives;
• Work collaboratively with the learner to select methods,
materials, and resources for instruction;
and
• Evaluate the quality of the learning experience
and make adjustments, as needed, while assessing
needs for further learning.

## Teaching techniques
- whole group discussion (teacher to student)
- small group discussion (student to student && teacher to student)
- pairs exercise (student to student)
- individual exercise or individual reading/though (student)

Techniques are not mutually exclusive and can/should be combined throughout the extent of a workshop. The important thing is variation, it aids learning through active student engagement

## preparation
- set up space to encourage discussion
