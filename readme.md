## Checks on learning

- diagnostic
- formative
- summartive

academic habits, they once possessed are also long forgotten

building community and sense of ownership of learning


## Adult learning theory

- Moves from dependency to increasing selfdirectedness
as he/she matures and can direct
his/her own learning;
- Draws on his/her accumulated reservoir of life
experiences to aid learning;
- Is ready to learn when he/she assumes new social
or life roles;
- Is problem-centered and wants to apply new
learning immediately; and
- Is motivated to learn internally rather than externally

implications for practice:

Set a cooperative climate for learning in the classroom;
• Assess the learner’s specific needs and interests;
• Develop learning objectives based on the learner’s
needs, interests, and skill levels;
• Design sequential activities to achieve the objectives;
• Work collaboratively with the learner to select methods,
materials, and resources for instruction;
and
• Evaluate the quality of the learning experience
and make adjustments, as needed, while assessing
needs for further learning.

## Teaching techniques
- whole group discussion (teacher to student)
- small group discussion (student to student && teacher to student)
- pairs exercise (student to student)
- individual exercise or individual reading/though (student)

Techniques are not mutually exclusive and can/should be combined throughout the extent of a workshop. The important thing is variation, it aids learning through active student engagement
